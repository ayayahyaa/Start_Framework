# Start_Framework
â€œMy first step into the world of web development using Angular! ðŸŒŸðŸ’»

I created a simple website that demonstrates the concept of connecting components and organizing routes in a clear and smooth way. Itâ€™s a hands-on project to apply the basics of the framework, work with routing, and link ideas together. A small start, but full of excitement and passion for learning and exploring more! ðŸš€âœ¨
